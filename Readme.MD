* Introduction

As part of the coursera course "Exploratory Data Analysis" we took a look at the Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) dataset. This dataset is known as the National
Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at the
[[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html][EPA National Emissions Inventory web site]].

Goal was to answer all of the questions below with a graph. 


* Questions

- Have total emissions from PM_{2.5} decreased in the United States from 1999 to
  2008?

  from 1999 to 2008?

- Of the four types of sources indicated by the =type= (point, nonpoint, onroad,
  nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in
  emissions from 1999-2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in
  emissions from 1999-2008?
